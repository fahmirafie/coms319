# Introduction to Test-Driven Development (Ctd.)

## Simple design

- Principle - KIS (keep it simple)
  - Build software to a simple design: Through programmer testing and design improvement, keep the software simple and the design suided to current functionality

- Output:
  - CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration-**not covered in this class**)
  - **UML diagrams**: Divides structural and behavioral modelling from each other

## Use case diagrams (UML) for simple design (system modeling)

## Use case diagram - Example: Airport Passenger Service

- Airport Checking Scenario

## Use case text - Desribing use case in text format

- Use case name
- Main  **scenario**
  - **Steps**
- Extensions
  - Extension condition; steps

- Specify **what** to do, **not how** to do!
- Do not specift user interface
- Optional: priority, trigger, pre-condition, post-condition(guarantees), sub-use case

## Use case text - Example

- **Name:**
  - Create homework

- **Participating actor:**
  - College student

- **Input condition:**
  - Student receives exercise sheet
  - Student is healthy

- **Output condition:**
  - Student makes solution

- **Flow of events:**

## activity diagrams

- An activity - multiple actions
  - Can be used **to describe a use case**
  - Can represent prarallel relationship

- AN activity diagram describes a procedure
  - Operation or buseniess processes

## Activity diagram - Main components

- Main components

## Refactoring

- What is the problem of KIS?
  - Simplicty vs. generality

- Solution is Refactoring
  - Teams design and revise design through refactoring in the course of the project

- Continuous design improvement process by 'refactoring':
  - **Removal of duplication**
  - **Increase cohesion**
  - **Reduce coupling**

## Continous integration

- Teams keep the system fully integrated at all times
- Daily, or multiple times a day builds
- Avoid **'integration hell**'
- Avoid code freezes
- **Integrate your function only if all unit tests run 100%!**

## Implementation - Pair programming

- Code is built by two programmers, sitting side by side, at the same machine (pilot/co-pilot)
- All production code is therefore reviewd by at least one other programmer

## Collective code ownership

- Any pair of programmers can improve any code at any time
- No secure owkrspaces
- All code gets the benefit of many people's attention
- Avoid duplication
- Programmer tests catch mistakes
- Pair with expert when working on unfamiliar code

## Whole Team - Customer on-site

- All contributors to an XP/TDD project are one team
- Must include a business representative - the 'customer on-site'
  - Provides requirements
  - Sets priorities
  - Steers project

- Team members are **programmers, testers, analysts,** coach, manager
  - Coach: supports the team in adhering to practices

## Interaction between customer and developer

## Customer tests (acceptance tests)

- The ccustomer defines one or more automated acceptance tests for a feature
- Team builds these tests to verify that a feature is implemented correctly
- Once the test runs, the team ensures that it keeps running correctly thereafter
- System always improves, never backslides

## XP rule - Designing

- **Simplicity**
- Choose a system metaphor
  - Teams develop a common vision of the system
  - Everyone understands how the system works

- Use CRC cards or **UML diagrams** for design sessions
- Create **spike** solutions to reduce risk
  - **Spike**:

## XP rule - Coding

## XP rule - Testing

- All code must have unit tests

## Typical XP artifcats

- **Story cards**
- Task cards
- Delivery plan
- Iteration plan
- **Code and tests**
- Acceptance tests

## Scrum - Project management

- Scrum is a process model for agile project management(for this course we focus on agile **development practices - XP/TDD practices**)

Product backlog -> Sprint Backlog ->  -> Release

## Did agile process solve the problems

- Process adaptation! (as we did it for our group projects!)
- Customer involvement: difficult to find a customer who can become part of the XP/TDD team
- Architectural design: the incremental style of development can cause inappropriate architectural decisions at an early stage of the process
  - Not clear until many features have been implemented and refactoring could make the architecture very expensive
