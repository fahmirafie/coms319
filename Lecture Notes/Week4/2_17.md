# Javascript Asynchronous Operations

## Arrow Functions - Recap

- Functions:

```js
hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

- With Arrow Functions:

```js
hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

- With Arrow Functions (Return Value by Default):

```js
hello = () => "Hello World!";
```

- Arrow Function With Parameters:

```js
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;
```

- Arrow Function Without Parentheses:

```js
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
```

## IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

- IIFE: A function is immediately invoked and executed as soon as it is defined
- Variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world
- Immecdiately executes the code and obtain data privacy

```js
let paintColor = 'red'

const paint = (() => {

}
```

## Hoisitng - JavaScript Interpreter

- Hoisting: JavaScript interpreter always moves the variables and function declaration to the top of the current scope (function scope / global scope) before the code execution
- Example:

```js
function cowSays(sound) {
  console.log(sound)
}
cowSays('moo');
moo

cowSays('moo);
function cowSays(sound) {
  console.log(sound)
}
moo
```

- Same output without error!

## Closures

- Closures extend behavior such as pass variables, methods, or arrays from an outer function to an inner function

- `second()` extends the behavior of the function `first()` and has acess to the variable `greet`

- The parent scope won't have the access of child scope variable `name`

- Achieve **object-oriented behavior** through closures
  - `const newFunc` as an object having property `greet` and `second()` a method

```js
const first = () => {
  const greet = 'Hi';
  const second = () => {
    const name = 'john';
    console.log(greet);
  }
  return second;
}

const newFUnc = first();

newFunc();  \\ prints to console 'Hi'
```

## Asynchronous operations in JavaScript

- Callback
- Promises
- async & wait

## Promises

- **Promises** avoid recursive structure of callback - 'callback hell'
- A promise is in three possible states:
  - Fulfilled: When the operation is completed successfully
  - Rejected: When the operation is failed
  - Pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected

- Chainingg operations wwith promise

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  isNameExist = true;
  if(isNameExist) {
    resolve("User name exists")
  } else {
    reject ("error")
  }
})

promise.then(result => console.log(result))
.catch(() => {
  console.log('error !')
})


```
