- Threads
  - Why threads are needed?
  - Threads vs Processes

Questions (1):

1. What are some reasons that a program cannot execute an instruction immediately?
2. What's a process?
    - A process is a program in execution
    - States of a process
3. How do so many processes execute at the  same time?

Questions (2):

1. What's a thread?
2. What are differences between a process and a thread?
3. How are mechanisms for creating threads in Java?

## Motivation for threads

- One of the major concepts we learned in prgramming is that program execution proceeds step by step. Until a step is **completed**, the next step **cannot be started**

- Consider the following scenarios:
  - Scenario (1): Printing a large file
  - Scenario (2): Loading a web page

## Processes vs. threads (2)

- Processes
  - Communication explicit
  - Oftne requires replication of data

## Context switch between processes

- Switiching the CPU to another process is costly (context switch between threads ios cheaper)!
- It requires saving the sate of the old processes and loading the saved state for the new process
  - When a process is suspened/interrupted its state is saved in PCB (Process COntrol Block) and will be loaded again when it is ready to run

## Multithreading models

- User-level threads
  - Supported above the kernel
  - Implemented by a thread library
  - Creation, scheduling, and management in user space
