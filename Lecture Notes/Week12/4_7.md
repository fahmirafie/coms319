## Outline

- User interfaces
  - UI vs UX

- Data visualization
- UI Design process
- UX Design
- Case Study: Mobile Web UX Design
- User interface development process

## User interface

- User interface: Way by which end-users will interact with your software
- Should take into consideration users' expectations, experience and skills
- Bad interface -> low usability

- Human errors have been correlated to the usability of user interface (J. Galliers and et al, ACM TCHI)
  - Confirmation dialog box

- Examples of excellent UI:
  - AirBnB, DropBox, ...

- Examples of poor UI
  - IBM Lotus Notes
  - Windows 8

## User Interface (UI) vs. User Experience (UX)

- **UI** design is all about how the product's interfaces look and function
  - The look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product
  - Process of **making interfaces in software** or computerized devices with a **focus on looks or style**

- **UX** design is all about the overall feel of the experience
  - Focused on the optimization of a product for **effective and enjoyable use**
  - Used to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users
  - UX design is **NOT** about visuals; it focuses on the overall feel of the website

## UI vs. UX

- Focus of UI lies in the **visual part** of what you see on screen
- Focus of the UX is on designing the **navigation experience** of the user and the product **logical flow** from one step to the next

**Wireframe** is a web layout of a web page/app that demonstrates what interface elements will exist on key pages

**Personas** are ficitonal but represent a selection of real users and their behaviors

### Responsibilities of UX and UI designers

#### What UX designer does

- Creates an app concept from scratch
- Studies and analyzes the behavior of potential users
- Elaborates scenarios and tasks flows
- Does research
- Outlines wireframes
- Makes prototypes
- Follows human-centered design

#### What UI designer does

- Works out a visible part of the application
- Works according to the requirements provided by a client
- Matches colors and typograghy
- Creates layouts
- Composes graphics
- Builds mockups
- Takes care of visual design

UI designers work very closely with UX designers

## Designing User Interface (UI)

UI designers:

- **Create** and design interfaces using different tools such as Sketch, Figma, Pencil, Photoshop, etc
- Conduct user **interface testing** to ensure the product meets its specifications
- Should consider these questions:
  - Do the **colors** work well together?
  - How is the **typography** used to convey meaning and hierarchy?
  - Is the app **well-designed?**
  - How can I improve the UI design of the app?
  - Would flat UI design work well?

** Visible language

- **Visible language: graphical techniques** used to communicate the message or context:
  - **Layout: formats, proportions, grids, and 2-D/3-D organization
  - **Typography**: selection of typefaces (fonts) and typesetting, including variable width and fixed width

- **Visible language: graphical techniques** used to communicate the message or context:
  - **Sequencing**: the overall approach to visual storytelling
  - **Sound**: abstrac, vocal, concrete, or musical class
  - **visual identity**:

## Use of a visbile language - Fundamental principles

1. **Organize**: provide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure

-> Consistency, screen layout, relationships and navigability

2. Economize: do the most the least amount of cues

1. **Organize:** provide the user wit ha clear and consistent conceptual structure (consistency, screen layout, relationships and navigability)
   1. **Layout**
   2. **Consistency**: Same kinds of elements are shown in the same places

1. **Organize:** provide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure (consistency, screen layout, relationships and])

2. **Economize**: do the most with the least amount of cues
   1. Simplicity, clarity, distinctiveness, and emphasis

## Design principles for user interfaces

- UI Design Issues
- UI Design Process


## User Design Issues

## Human Factors

- Limited short-term memory
  - How many items of information can one remember instantaneously

- Familiarity
  - Use terms and concepts from the domain of the  application

- Consistency
  - Similar/comparable operations should be activated in the same way

- Error recovery & guidance
  - Provide meaningful, unambiguous feedback when errors occur

## Interaction styles

1. Obtaining information from the user
2. Presenting information to the user

- Direct
- Transformed (**visualized**)

Information to be displayed -> Presentation software -> Display

## UI Design Process

- User Analysis
  - Understand what users will do with the system
- Prototyping
  - Develop (many) prototypes
- Evaluation
  - Experiment with the prototypes

### User Analysis

- Ask questions, show examples, explain what can (more importantly cannot) be done, ...
  
## Prototyping

- Ask question, show examples
