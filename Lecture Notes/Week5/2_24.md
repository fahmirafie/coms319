# Introduction to React Framework

## Libraries and frameworks for Node.js & JavaScript

- Libraries/frameworks
  - **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces by Facebook
  - **Angular/Angular.js**: TypeScript-based/JavaScript by Google
  - **Vue.js**: rapidly growing JS framework

## JavaScript framework - React

- **React** is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces for the web
- It allows developers to write highly efficient JavaScript for the purpose of rendering a UI
- Is is an **open source**

## A bit of history

Who?\

- React is created by Jordan Walke at Facebook

## Who uses React?

- Facebook
- Asana
- Netflix
- Dropbox
- Khan Academy
- Reddit
- Instagram

## Why should I use React?

- Easy to read and understand views
- Components are the future of web development
- If your page uses a lot of fast updating data or real time data - React is the way to go
- Once you are over the React's learning curve, developing an app will become a lot faster

## React fundamentals

- Components
- Props
- State
- JSX
- Virtual DOM

## React - "Hello World!"

- Create a component called 'Test', which is rendered in a container called 'root':

index.js

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Test extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Test />, document.getELementById('root'));
```

index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport">
```

## JSX (JavaScript XML)

- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript
- JSX allows you to write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code
- JSX helps in making the code easier to understand and debug as it avoids usage of JS DOM structures which are rather complex

```jsx
const hello = (<h1>Hello World!</h1>);
//  JS                 HTML
```

## Virtual DOM

- A virtual DOM is used for efficient re-endering of the DOM (Document Object Model treats XML or HTML document as a tree structure)
- REeact aims to re-render the virtual tree only when the state changes (The state of these two objects has changed so they need to be re-rendered)

## Components

- Components are self-contained reusable building blocks of web applications
- They describe pioeces of your UI

- Two way of declaring a component
  1. Function Component
  2. Class Component

Function Component:

```js

```

Class Components:\
YOu can create more complex components by taking advantage of JavaScript classes

```js
class Title extends React.Component {
  render() {

  }
}
```

## State

- State of a component is an object that holds some data
- This data influences the output of the component

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    // This is how we store some data in state
    this.state = {
      car: "Toyota",
      bicycle: "Trek"
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        // This is how we access the state properties
        <h1>{this.state.car}</h1>
        <h1>{this.state.bicycle}</h1>
    )
  }
}
```

## Props

- Props is short for properties, that allow us to pass arguments or data to components
- Props are passed to components in the way similar to that of HTML tag

Main.js

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App.js';

ReactDOM.render (
  // This is how we pass the properties to a component
  <App carProp="Toyota" bikeProp="Trek"/>,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

App.js

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      
      <h1>{this.props.carProp}</h1>
      <h1>{this.props.bikeProp}</h1>
    )
  }
}
```

## Beyond ReactJS

- React goes beyond simple UI and has many extensions for complete application support
- It provides server-side rendering
- Supports mobile app development

## React Native
