# JavaScript Concepts

## Javascript Asynchronous Operations

### Callbacks - Example

**Without callback:**

```js
function myDisplayer(some) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
}

function myCalculator(num1, num2) {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  myDisplayer(sum);
}

myCalculator(5, 5);
```

**With callback:**

```js
function myDisplayer(some) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
}

function myCalculator(num1, num2, myCallback) {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  myCallback(sum);
}

myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
```

### Promise - Syntax

- "Producing code" is code that can take some time
- "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result
- A Promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code

### Async & Await - Syntax

- **async** before a funciton makes the function return a promise
- **await** before a function makes the function wait for a promise

```js
async function myDisplay() {
  ler promise =
}
```

## JavaScript Prototype-Based Inheritance\

### Classes - UML class diagram

// TODO

### Class diagram - Example

- Describe the types of objects in the system
- Describes the static relationships among them

### Inheritance

### Inheritance - "is-a" relationship

- Let A and B be classes, and Omega_A and Omega_B the set of objects that make up classes A and B
  - Then B is a subclass / aspecialization of A(or A is)

### Prototype-based inheritance

- JAvascript is different form traditional object-oriented lanugages that is uses **prototype inheritance**
- In a nutshell, prototype inheritance in Javascript works like this:

1. An object has a number of properties. This includes and attributes or functions (methods)
2. AN object has a **special parent proerty**,
3. An object can ovveride a property of its parent by setting the property on itself
4. A constructor creates objects. Each constructor has an associated prototype object, which is simply another object
5. When an object is created, its parent is set to the prototype object associated with the constructor that created it
6. The prototype objects aare used to implement *inheritance* with the mechanism of **dynamic dispact (delegation)

### Static vs. dynamic dispatch

- Static dispatch: references are resolved at compile time
- Dynamic dispatch: resolves the references at runtime

- Static dispatch in Java:

  - A class may have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types
  - Method calls are dispatched to the method with the right number of parameters that has the most specific types that the actual parameters could match

### Overloading (static dispatch) - Example

```java
public class Sum {
  // overloaded
}
```

Dynamic (virtual method) dispatch in Java
